        <h2>1. Who is Harry Potter?</h2>
        <p>
          Harry Potter is a fictional character and the protagonist of J.K. Rowling's iconic book series.
          He is a young wizard known for his bravery, loyalty, and the unique lightning-shaped scar on
          his forehead, a mark left by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort during an attack that killed
          Harry's parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born on July 31, 1980, Harry is raised by his cruel relatives, the Dursleys, who treat him poorly
          and hide the truth about his magical heritage. On his 11th birthday, Harry discovers he is a
          wizard and receives an invitation to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
          There, he finds a sense of belonging and forms close friendships with Ron Weasley and
          Hermione Granger, who become his trusted allies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harry is courageous and selfless, often risking his life to protect others. Throughout the series,
          he grapples with the weight of his destiny as "The Chosen One," prophesied to defeat
          Voldemort and restore peace to the wizarding world. Despite his fame and extraordinary
          abilities, Harry remains humble, valuing love, friendship, and justice above all else.

          Joanne Rowling, known professionally as J.K. Rowling, is the British author who created the
          Harry Potter series, one of the most successful and beloved literary franchises of all time. Born

          a young age. However, her journey to literary success was far from easy.

          <h3>3.2 Inspirations for the Harry Potter universe</h3>
          <p>
            The Harry Potter series was shaped by a combination of J.K. Rowling's personal experiences,
            literary influences, and elements from mythology and folklore.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal Experiences:</strong> Rowling's own struggles with loss and loneliness influenced
              themes of family, sacrifice, and overcoming hardship. The death of her mother and her
              life as a single mother were pivotal in shaping Harry's emotional journey.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mythology and Folklore:</strong> Many creatures and elements of the magical world draw
              from British folklore and classical mythology. For example, Cerberus (the threeheaded dog) and Minerva McGonagall (named after the Roman goddess of wisdom)
              reflect these influences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Literary Influences:</strong> Rowling was inspired by works such as C.S. Lewis's Chronicles
              of Narnia, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, and classic British school stories. These
              authors' use of magical worlds and themes of good versus evil shaped her storytelling
              style.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Historical and Social Context:</strong> Elements of the wizarding world, like the Ministry of
              Magic, are influenced by British societal structures. The rise of Voldemort and his
              followers parallels the themes of fascism and totalitarianism, echoing the conflict of
              WWII.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fairy Tales and Magic:</strong> Rowling's love of fairy tales and magic is reflected in the
              enchanted objects, magical creatures, and moral lessons in the series, such as bravery,
              love, and the battle between good and evil.

        <h2>4. The Wizarding World: A Unique Setting</h2>
        <p>
          The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a rich and imaginative universe that is intricately
          detailed and full of wonder, mystery, and danger. J.K. Rowling crafted a world that exists
          alongside the ordinary, or Muggle, world, yet is entirely separate, with its own rules, magical
          creatures, and history. This unique setting is one of the main elements that contributes to the
          enduring appeal of the series.

          <h3>4.1 Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h3>
          <p>
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or simply Hogwarts, is the central setting for
            much of the Harry Potter series. It is a magical boarding school located in the Scottish
            Highlands and serves as the educational institution for young witches and wizards in the United
            Kingdom. The school plays a crucial role in shaping the characters, particularly Harry Potter,
            and serves as a backdrop for many of the adventures, friendships, and challenges that the
            students face.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Location and Appearance:</strong> Hogwarts is located in a remote part of Scotland, hidden
              from the non-magical world, with enchanted spells preventing Muggles from seeing it.
              The castle itself is vast and ancient, with towering spires, turrets, and numerous hidden
              rooms. It is surrounded by a large, mysterious forest known as the Forbidden Forest
              and a shimmering lake, home to many magical creatures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Heart of the Series:</strong> Hogwarts is arguably the most iconic and beloved location in
              the Wizarding World. It is a magical school where young witches and wizards receive
              their education in various magical subjects, such as Potions, Defense Against the Dark
              Arts, and Transfiguration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Magical Architecture:</strong> The school itself is filled with magic, from the moving
              staircases and secret passages to the enchanted ceilings of the Great Hall, which reflect
              the weather outside. The castle is also home to countless magical artifacts, including
              the Sorting Hat, which chooses the house for each new student.

        <h2>5. The Role of Magic in Harry Potter</h2>
        <p>
          Magic is at the heart of the Harry Potter series, shaping the world in which the characters live
          and influencing the events that unfold throughout the story. It is not just a tool for performing
          extraordinary feats but also a metaphor for themes such as power, responsibility, and the nature
          of good versus evil. Magic in the Harry Potter universe is multifaceted, and its role extends far
          beyond the spell-casting and creature encounters that we typically associate with the term.
          Below are key aspects of how magic functions and plays a pivotal role throughout the series.
        </p>

        <section id="magic-symbolism">
          <h3>5.1 The symbolism of magic in the story</h3>
          <p>
            Magic in Harry Potter goes beyond a mere tool for casting spells; it serves as a powerful
            symbol that reflects the series' themes and the characters' journeys. Here are key symbolic
            meanings of magic in the story:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Magic as Power and Responsibility</strong><br />
              Magic represents power and how it's used responsibly. Voldemort symbolizes the corrupting
              influence of unchecked power, using magic for domination. In contrast, Harry learns to use
              magic selflessly, symbolizing moral growth and the importance of responsibility.
              Magic symbolizes personal growth. For Harry, it represents his journey of self-discovery as
              he learns about his past and purpose. Hermione's growth with magic reflects intellectual
              empowerment and the value of hard work.
              Magic connects to identity, especially through the concept of blood status (pure-blood, halfblood, Muggle-born). Hermione, as a Muggle-born, challenges societal prejudices, while
              Voldemort's obsession with blood purity highlights the dangers of such divisions. Magic also
              reflects themes of discrimination, seen in the treatment of magical creatures.
              In summary, magic in Harry Potter symbolizes power, growth, and identity, shaping both the
              characters' journeys and the moral lessons of the series.
